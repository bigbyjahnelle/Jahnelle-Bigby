# Jahnelle-Bigby
HELLO I’m **Jahnelle**, a Computer Programming & Information Systems student with a passion for transforming technical logic into efficient, organized solutions. I began my journey coding in HTML and soon realized that what truly excites me is the structure, flow, and planning behind the scenes, though I know Java, Python and C++ very well. Today, I’m focused on applying my analytical mindset and leadership potential toward project management—organizing teams, coordinating workflows, and delivering projects with clarity and purpose. I’m actively seeking internships where I can gain hands-on experience in planning and execution while growing into a project management role.
